# My Awesome Portfolio

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website built using **Svelte** and **TailwindCSS**. It's fully responsive and looks great on all devices.

## Features

- **Animated Background**: The website features an animated background using `particles.js`.
- **Projects Section**: A dedicated section to showcase my projects.
- **About Me Section**: A section where you can learn more about me.
- **Resume**: My resume is included with an option to download it.
- **Footer**: The footer includes all my important social links.

## Technologies Used

- **Svelte**: A modern JavaScript compiler that allows me to write easy-to-understand JavaScript code that then compiles to highly efficient code that runs in the browser.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **particles.js**: A lightweight JavaScript library for creating particles.
